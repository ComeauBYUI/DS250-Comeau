### Grand Questions

1. __Create 2-3 charts that evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and `before1980`.__
1. __Can you build a classification model (before or after 1980) that has at least 90% accuracy for the state of Colorado to use (explain your model choice and which models you tried)?__
1. __Will you justify your classification model by detailing the most important features in your model (a chart and a description are a must)?__
1. __Can you describe the quality of your classification model using 2-3 evaluation metrics?__
    1. __You need to explain how to interpret each evaluation metric when you provide the value.__
