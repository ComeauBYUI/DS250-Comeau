## SQL queries are typed in the following pattern;

```SQL
SELECT -- <columns> and <column calculations>
FROM -- <table name>
  JOIN -- <table name>
  ON -- <columns to join>
WHERE -- <filter condition>
GROUP BY -- <subsets for column calculations>
ORDER BY -- <how the output is returned in sequence>
LIMIT -- <number of rows to return>
```

> Pick any two baseball teams and compare them using a metric of your choice (average salary, home runs, number of wins, etc.). Write an SQL query to get the data you need. Use Python if additional data wrangling is needed, then make a graph in Altair to visualize the comparison. Provide the visualization and the compiled Vega script that would build the visualization.
